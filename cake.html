                <p><strong>Black Forest gâteau or Black Forest cake (American English)</strong> is a chocolate sponge cake with a rich cherry 
                    filling based on the German dessert Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte (pronounced [ˈʃvaʁt͡svɛldɐ ˈkɪʁʃˌtɔʁtə] 
                    (listen)), literally "Black Forest Cherry-torte". Typically, Black Forest gateau consists of several 
                    layers of chocolate sponge cake sandwiched with whipped cream and cherries. It is decorated with additional 
                    whipped cream, maraschino cherries, and chocolate shavings. In some European traditions, sour cherries are 
                    used both between the layers and for decorating the top.[2] Traditionally, kirschwasser, a clear spirit 
                    made from sour cherries, is added to the cake.[3] Other spirits are sometimes used, such as rum, which is 
                    common in Austrian recipes. German law mandates that any dessert labeled Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte must have kirschwasser. The dessert is not directly named after the Black Forest 
                    mountain range in southwestern Germany. According to one school of thought, the name is derived from the 
                    specialty liquor of that region, known as Schwarzwälder Kirsch(wasser), which is distilled from tart 
                    cherries. This is the ingredient that gives the dessert its distinctive cherry pit flavor and alcoholic 
                    content flavor.
